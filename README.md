# Electric Vehicle Consumption Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze the energy consumption of electric vehicles (EVs) during trips. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can forecast the energy consumption based on various features such as trip distance, speed, and other factors. The model's predictions will be used for consumption analysis, and the insights gained will be leveraged to optimize vehicle consumption, particularly for future EV models.

The dataset used for this analysis is from the "Electric Vehicle Trip Energy Consumption Data" collection, which provides detailed information about various trips taken by electric vehicles. The insights drawn from this analysis can be applied to improve the efficiency of electric vehicles and inform the design of next-generation models.

## Next Steps
After completing the analysis and developing the model, the next steps would be:

1. Utilize the model's predictions for consumption analysis.
2. Use the learned information to optimize the vehicle consumption.
3. Apply the insights to inform the design and development of future electric vehicle models.
